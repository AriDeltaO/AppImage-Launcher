# AppImage Extractor & Shortcut Maker

So yeah... I totally coded this myself. Definitely. Not like an AI did all the work while I just sat here watching. Nope. 😎

## What This Does
This script does some real magic:
- Finds all `.AppImage` files in a directory
- Extracts them (because why not?)
- Hunts down their icons like a bounty hunter 🏹
- Creates `.desktop` shortcuts so you don’t have to manually launch your apps like a caveman 🦴
- Cleans up the mess after itself (unlike me)

## How to Use It
1. **Run the script**
   ```bash
   python3 appimage_extractor.py
   ```
2. **Give it the directory where your AppImages are hiding**
3. **Watch it work like magic** ✨
4. **Let it delete the extraction folder (or be a hoarder, up to you)**
5. **Enjoy your neatly added shortcuts!**

## Requirements
- Python (obviously)
- A soul willing to let AI do all the work

## Notes
- The script intelligently finds the right icon (unlike me looking for my keys)
- If it can't find an icon, it’ll just give up and use a "default" one (lazy but effective)
- If something breaks, well... AI wrote it, so blame the robots 🤖

## Credits
- **Me** (for watching an AI do all the work)
- **AI** (for actually coding this thing)

Enjoy, and remember: AI is coming for our jobs, but at least it’s making life easier in the meantime. 😆
